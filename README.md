# Explorer Patcher
Explorer Patcher is a patcher that enables various stuff in Explorer. For the moment, it includes the following:

* allows using the old taskbar in Windows 11 without the side effects of UndockingDisabled and with fully working search, modern apps showing properly, screen snip still working etc

A detailed description of how this works is available on my web site [here](https://valinet.ro/2021/08/09/Restore-Windows-11-to-working-Windows-10-UI.html).

Precompiled binaries are available in [Releases](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/releases).

To install, save the executable in a safe directory, run it once as an administrator to have it register as [Taskman](https://www.geoffchappell.com/notes/windows/shell/explorer/taskman.htm) for Explorer and just restart Explorer or reboot.
